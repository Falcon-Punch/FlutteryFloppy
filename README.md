# Fluttery Floppy Fish-Bee-Alien

This was the final project for a 2-week crash course on Android Programming.
The final assignment was a 2-person group project that had to be completed 
in 4 days. We were required to develop a game of our choice, as long as 
it was a mobile game for Android. We were required to implement object-oriented 
design methods, but besides that we were pretty open to create whatever we wanted.
