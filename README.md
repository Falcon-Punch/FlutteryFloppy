# Fluttery Floppy Fish-Bee-Alien

This was the final project for a 2-week crash course on Android Programming.
The final assignment was a 2-person group project that had to be completed 
in 4 days. The assignment was to develop a game of our choice, as long as 
it was a mobile game for Android. We were required to implement sprites in 
a meaningful way, object-oriented design methods, and to research and implement
something new that we did not learn within the course. We decided to implement 
the Flappy Bird Android game, with a few twists and this is what we came up with.

We were also required to give a 15-minute presentation after completing the game.
The presentation was mostly vocal, so there is mostly pictures and diagrams on
the slides. Here is the presentation we gave after 4 days of non-stop coding:
